- [ ] CallCoordinator.ts
    - Simplify whole code structure for readability *remove the `else` keyword
    - Clear the logs, remove the __DEV__ check.
- [ ] backgroundNotificationTask.ts
    - Simplify the data parsing *use zod schemas
    - Clear the logs, so many console.log calls in different lines, could be merged into singles.
- [ ] TokenStorage.ts
    - Remove feature flags entirely, there is no need for this in this application.
    - Remove the migration from AsyncStorage, the app is not shipped to real users yet so this is entirely unnecessary
    - The key sanitizing/parsing Could also be done by a zod schema and some .refine()
- [ ] CallSession.ts
    - Aggregate the raw `fetch` calls into a new InterfoneAPI class into a new file. there we can do better type validation agains the interfone-api. Maybe use openapi schemas or zod schemas
    - Also need to figure out if there is more raw fetch() calls to the interfone-api in other files and refactor them aswell
